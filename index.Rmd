# New York Times Blog Analysis  
This project was the capstone project for MIT's Analytics Edge course and offered on EdX. The competition itself was hosted on Kaggle. The objecive of the competition was to predict whether a NY Times article would be popular. My model predicted the correct outcome with 89% accuracy which was only 3 percent behind the competition winner. You can see the analysis in the link above or by installing the package and reading the vignette.
